    "Each of these values (e.g. 165) is a measurement of the variable *height*.\n",
    "We call *height* a variable because its value isn't constant.\n",
    "If everyone in the world were the same height, we wouldn't call height a variable, and we also wouldn't bother measuring it, because we'd know everyone is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have different **types** that can affect your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-1 Nominal\n",
    "\n",
    "A nominal variable consists of unordered categories, like *male* or *female* for biological sex.\n",
    "Notice that these categories are not numbers, and there is no order to the categories.\n",
    "We do not say that male comes before female or is smaller than female.\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #8B0000;\">\n",
    "Example: Pet Type - Consider a survey question asking respondents about the type of pet they own: Dog, Cat, Bird, or None. These categories serve to classify responses but do not imply any order or ranking.\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-2 Ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal variables consist of ordered categories.\n",
    "You can think of it as nominal data but with an ordering from first to last or smallest to largest.\n",
    "A common example of ordinal data are Likert questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1) Strongly disagree\n",
    "(2) Disagree\n",
    "(3) Neither agree nor disagree\n",
    "(4) Agree\n",
    "(5) Strongly agree\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though these options are numbered 1 to 5, those numbers only indicate which comes before the others, not how \"big\" an option is.\n",
    "For example, we wouldn't say that the difference between *Agree*  and *Disagree* is the same as the difference between *Neither agree nor disagree* and *Strongly agree*.\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #8B0000;\">\n",
    "Example: Education Level - Education levels listed as Elementary, High School, College, and Postgraduate. While there is a clear order to these categories, the difference in educational attainment between each level isn't quantified.\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-3 Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval variables are ordered *and* their measurement scales are evenly spaced.\n",
    "A classic example is temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
    "In degrees Fahrenheit, the difference between 70 and 71 is the same as the difference between 90 and 91 - either case is one degree.\n",
    "The other most important characteristic of interval variables is also the most confusing one, which is that interval variables don't have a meaningful zero value.\n",
    "Degrees Fahrenheit is an example of this because there's nothing special about 0 degrees. \n",
    "0 degrees doesn't mean there's no temperature or no heat energy, it's just an arbitrary point on the scale.\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #8B0000;\">\n",
    "Example: Time of Day - Recorded in hours, such as 10:00, 11:00, 12:00. The difference between each hour is constant, but 0:00 does not imply the absence of time.\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2-4 Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio variables are like interval variables but with meaningful zeros.\n",
    "Age and height are good examples because 0 age means you have no age, and 0 height means you have no height.\n",
    "The name *ratio* reflects that you can form a ratio with these variables, which means that you can say age 20 is twice as old as age 10.\n",
    "Notice you can't say that about degrees Fahrenheit: 100 degrees is not really twice as hot as 50 degrees, because 0 degrees Fahrenheit doesn't mean \"no temperature.\"\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #8B0000;\">\n",
    "Example: Distance Traveled - Measured in kilometers on a trip. This variable has a true zero point (no travel), and differences and ratios are meaningful.\n",
