    "Data science is about discovering patterns and making sense of the vast amounts of information around us. From the numbers in a weather forecast to the recommendations on your favorite streaming service, data science influences how we understand and interact with the world. At its core, data science involves working with variablesâ€”pieces of information that change depending on the context. For example, a person's height, age, and weight are all variables that help describe them. However these variables come in different forms, and understanding their nature is essential for meaningful analysis.\n",

    "In this study, you can explore the different types of variables and how they shape data interpretation. It then delves into how data is structured, such as in tables and spreadsheets, which allow us to organize and analyze information efficiently. Finally, you will see how dataframes, powerful tools in data science, enable us to manipulate data dynamically.\n",
    "By the end of this study, you will see how the various components of data science connect, allowing you to understand and work with data intuitively. Instead of just memorizing definitions, you will gain an appreciation for how data is structured and used in real-world applications, helping you think like a little more of a data scientist.

    "## Types of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured data begins with **measurements** of some type of thing in the real world, which we call a **variable**.\n",
    "Consider the example of height. \n",
    "I may measure 10 people and find that their heights in centimeters are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Height |\n",
    "|--------|\n",
    "| 165    |\n",
    "| 188    |\n",
    "| 153    |\n",
    "| 164    |\n",
    "| 150    |\n",
    "| 190    |\n",
    "| 169    |\n",
    "| 163    |\n",
    "| 165    |\n",
    "| 190    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these values (e.g. 165) is a measurement of the variable *height*.\n",
    "We call *height* a variable because its value isn't constant.\n",
    "If everyone in the world were the same height, we wouldn't call height a variable, and we also wouldn't bother measuring it, because we'd know everyone is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have different **types** that can affect your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nominal\n",
    "\n",
    "A nominal variable consists of unordered categories, like *male* or *female* for biological sex.\n",
    "Notice that these categories are not numbers, and there is no order to the categories.\n",
    "We do not say that male comes before female or is smaller than female.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ordinal\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal variables consist of ordered categories.\n",
    "You can think of it as nominal data but with an ordering from first to last or smallest to largest.\n",
    "A common example of ordinal data are Likert questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(1) Strongly disagree\n",
    "(2) Disagree\n",
    "(3) Neither agree nor disagree\n",
    "(4) Agree\n",
    "(5) Strongly agree\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though these options are numbered 1 to 5, those numbers only indicate which comes before the others, not how \"big\" an option is.\n",
    "For example, we wouldn't say that the difference between *Agree*  and *Disagree* is the same as the difference between *Neither agree nor disagree* and *Strongly agree*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval variables are ordered *and* their measurement scales are evenly spaced.\n",
    "A classic example is temperature in Fahrenheit.\n",
    "In degrees Fahrenheit, the difference between 70 and 71 is the same as the difference between 90 and 91 - either case is one degree.\n",
    "The other most important characteristic of interval variables is also the most confusing one, which is that interval variables don't have a meaningful zero value.\n",
    "Degrees Fahrenheit is an example of this because there's nothing special about 0 degrees. \n",
    "0 degrees doesn't mean there's no temperature or no heat energy, it's just an arbitrary point on the scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio variables are like interval variables but with meaningful zeros.\n",
    "Age and height are good examples because 0 age means you have no age, and 0 height means you have no height.\n",
    "The name *ratio* reflects that you can form a ratio with these variables, which means that you can say age 20 is twice as old as age 10.\n",
    "Notice you can't say that about degrees Fahrenheit: 100 degrees is not really twice as hot as 50 degrees, because 0 degrees Fahrenheit doesn't mean \"no temperature.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: #8B0000;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comprehensive Example Involving All Variable Types \n",
    "\n",
    "Country (Nominal): Each participant's country of origin like USA, Canada, Japan, etc. This is a nominal variable as the categories (countries) do not have a mathematical order.\n",
    "Satisfaction Level (Ordinal): Participants rated their overall life satisfaction on a scale from 1 (Very Unsatisfied) to 5 (Very Satisfied). This is an ordinal variable because the rankings have an order but the intervals between the ranks are not necessarily equal.\n",
    "Temperature (Interval): The average yearly temperature (in Celsius) of the participant's city. Temperature is an interval variable because the difference between temperatures is meaningful, and the scale is evenly spaced, but zero is not an absence of temperature.\n",
    "Annual Income (Ratio): The yearly income of participants in USD. This is a ratio variable because it has a meaningful zero (no income), and the relationships between numbers are meaningful (e.g., an income of 40,000 USD is twice that of 20,000 USD).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Tabular data**, commonly found in spreadsheets, is the most prevalent form of structured data, organizing information into rows and columns for clarity and analysis. Each **row** in a tabular dataset typically represents an **observation** or **datapoint** (in statistics terminology) or an **item** (in machine learning terminology), such as a person, and includes measurements for various attributes like height, age, and weight. For example, a dataset with five rows suggests data on five different individuals. The **columns** in these tables are labeled with variable names, such as 'Height' at the top of a column, indicating the type of data stored in each column. The **column headers** serve as descriptive labels rather than actual data points, which is why they are not counted in the total number of data rows. This organization facilitates straightforward data analysis and manipulation.\n",
